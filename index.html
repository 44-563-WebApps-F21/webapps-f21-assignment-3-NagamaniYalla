<h2>Linear Algorithm Code</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p> A ternary search algorithm is a technique in computer science for finding the minimum or maximum of a unimodal function. A ternary search determines either that the minimum or maximum cannot be in the first third of the domain or that it cannot be in the last third of the domain, then repeats on the remaining two thirds.
         A ternary search is an example of a divide and conquer algorithm </p> </blockquote >
    <pre>  
    double ternary_search(double l, double r) {
        double eps = 1e-9;              //set the error limit here
        while (r - l > eps) {
            double m1 = l + (r - l) / 3;
            double m2 = r - (r - l) / 3;
            double f1 = f(m1);      //evaluates the function at m1
            double f2 = f(m2);      //evaluates the function at m2
            if (f1 < f2)
                l = m1;
            else
                r = m2;
        }
        return f(l);                    //return the maximum of f(x) in [l, r]
    }
